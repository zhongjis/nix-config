# jq: JSON Data Extraction Tool

Use jq to extract specific fields from JSON files without loading entire file contents into context.

## When to Use jq vs Read

**Use jq when:**

- Need specific field(s) from structured data file
- File is large (>50 lines) and only need subset
- Querying nested structures
- Filtering/transforming data
- **Saves 80-95% context** vs reading entire file

**Just use Read when:**

- File is small (<50 lines)
- Need to understand overall structure
- Making edits (need full context anyway)

## Common File Types

JSON files where jq excels:

- package.json, tsconfig.json
- Lock files (package-lock.json, yarn.lock in JSON format)
- API responses
- Configuration files

## Quick Examples

```bash
# Get version from package.json
jq -r .version package.json

# Get nested dependency version
jq -r '.dependencies.react' package.json

# List all dependencies
jq -r '.dependencies | keys[]' package.json
```

## Core Principle

Extract exactly what is needed in one command - massive context savings compared to reading entire files.
