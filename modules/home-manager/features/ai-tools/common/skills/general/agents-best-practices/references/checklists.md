## Workflow orchestration checklist

- [ ] Workflow is justified by decomposition, broad coverage, parallel read-only work, verification needs, or resume requirements.
- [ ] Single-worker loop was considered first.
- [ ] Workflow artifact states objective, scope, success criteria, packet definitions, verification strategy, integration rules, and budgets.
- [ ] Approval binds to the exact workflow artifact version.
- [ ] Each packet has one purpose, explicit inputs, narrow tool permissions, output schema, timeout, budget, and evidence requirement.
- [ ] Worker contexts receive only packet-relevant context and tools.
- [ ] Risky side effects remain approval-gated and are not delegated to workers.
- [ ] Parallel execution is limited to independent, concurrency-safe work.
- [ ] Verifier contexts are independent enough to challenge findings.
- [ ] Integration rules cover deduplication, conflict resolution, confidence, coverage gaps, and failed packets.
- [ ] Workflow state is durable: plan, approvals, packet status, worker outputs, verifier outputs, integration notes, errors, and budget usage.
- [ ] Reproducibility state is captured: workflow version, model/runtime settings, tool calls, result references, source revision or data snapshot, and approval records.
- [ ] Final output distinguishes verified findings, rejected findings, unresolved questions, partial coverage, and next safe actions.

## Skills checklist

## Minimal provider-neutral implementation path

1. Build a manual model-tool-observation loop.
2. Add strict tool schemas and local validation.
3. Add runtime permission checks.
4. Add structured tool results and error observations.
5. Add budgets and stop conditions.
6. Add tracing.
7. Add prompt-cache-aware context ordering and cache telemetry.
8. Add planning mode for high-risk tasks.
9. Add context compaction.
10. Add skills for reusable workflows.
11. Add MCP/external connectors with scoped permissions.
12. Add goal-like loops only after the base agent passes evals.
13. Add subagents or worker pools only when decomposition improves measured results.
14. Add recurring knowledge-base and entropy cleanup workflows.

## Agent legibility checklist

- [ ] Top-level instructions are a map, not a giant manual.
- [ ] Source-of-truth documents are indexed and retrievable.
- [ ] Active and completed plans are stored as durable artifacts.
- [ ] Domain schemas, policies, and runbooks are agent-readable.
- [ ] Validation signals are accessible through approved tools.
- [ ] Logs, metrics, traces, audit events, or workflow status are queryable where relevant.
- [ ] Human feedback is converted into docs, tools, validators, or evals.
- [ ] Stale docs and obsolete tools have a cleanup process.
- [ ] Quality scorecards or known-gap trackers exist for large systems.

## Prompt caching checklist

- [ ] Stable instructions appear before volatile runtime state.
- [ ] Tool definitions and schemas are sorted deterministically.
- [ ] Dynamic values such as timestamps and request IDs are placed near the end or omitted.
- [ ] Prompt and tool bundle versions are tracked.
- [ ] Provider cached-token fields are logged.
- [ ] Cache hit rate is monitored by session and tenant or segment.
- [ ] System prompt and tool-list hashes are logged to detect fragmentation.
- [ ] Compaction boundaries are explicit.
- [ ] Summaries are not rewritten every turn.
- [ ] Long-retention cache settings are used only when reuse justifies them.

## Mechanical invariant checklist

- [ ] Architecture or workflow boundaries are enforced mechanically.
- [ ] Secret/PII/source-citation checks exist where relevant.
- [ ] Cost, latency, and tool-result-size budgets are enforced.
