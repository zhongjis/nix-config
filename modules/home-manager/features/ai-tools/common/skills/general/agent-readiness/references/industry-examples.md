## OpenAI — Codex Frontend

3 engineers, ~1,500 PRs, ~1M LOC, 3.5 PRs/engineer/day. Zero lines of manually-written code over 5 months.

**Infrastructure**:
- Per-worktree bootable app — each change gets its own running instance
- CDP wired into agent runtime — DOM snapshots, screenshots, navigation
- Ephemeral observability per worktree — logs, metrics, traces torn down after task
- Custom linters with error messages that inject remediation into agent context

**AGENTS.md**: ~100 lines, table of contents pointing to `docs/`. "We tried the big AGENTS.md. It failed."

**Architecture**: rigid layers mechanically enforced (Types → Config → Repo → Service → Runtime → UI). "Enforce boundaries centrally, allow autonomy locally."

**Review**: agent-to-agent (Ralph Wiggum Loop). Humans may review but aren't required.

**Slop management**: "golden principles" + background Codex tasks scan for deviations, open refactoring PRs. Technical debt as high-interest loan — pay down continuously.

## Anthropic — Evaluator Pattern

GAN-inspired three-agent pattern: Planner → Generator → Evaluator.

**How the evaluator works**:
1. Boots the app
2. Navigates key flows with Playwright MCP
3. Takes screenshots
4. Grades against predefined criteria (design quality, originality, craft, functionality)
5. Returns pass/fail with evidence and specific feedback

**Sprint contracts**: before each sprint, generator and evaluator negotiate testable "done" criteria.

**Key findings**:
- LLMs are terrible self-evaluators — confidently praise mediocre work
- Out of the box, Claude identifies issues then talks itself into approving
- Multiple tuning rounds needed: read evaluator logs → find judgment divergences → update QA prompt
- Opus 4.6 allowed removing sprint construct entirely (model handles coherence natively)

**Communication**: agents coordinate via files, not message passing.

**Cost**: solo $9/20min → full 3-agent setup $200/6hr. Simplified (Opus 4.6): $125/4hr.

## Stripe — Minions

1,300+ PRs/week. All human-reviewed, zero human-written code. Manages >$1 trillion annual payment volume.

**Devboxes**: cloud machines pre-loaded with codebase, 10-second spin-up via warm pool. QA-isolated. Built for humans years before agents — agents just slotted in.

**Blueprints**: hybrid orchestration mixing deterministic nodes (lint, push, PR template) with agentic nodes (implement, fix CI). "Putting LLMs into contained boxes compounds into reliability."

**Scoped rules**: global rules "very judiciously." Almost all rules scoped to subdirectories/file patterns, auto-attached as agent navigates. Same rules for Minions, Cursor, Claude Code.

**Feedback**: pre-push lint < 5 seconds (background daemon precomputes), selective CI from 3M+ tests with autofixes, max 2 CI rounds.

**Toolshed**: centralized MCP server with ~500 tools. Agents get curated subsets, not kitchen sink.

**Key insight**: "Investments in human developer productivity over time have returned to pay dividends in the world of agents."

## Datadog — Observability-Driven Verification

The most rigorous verification approach. Infrastructure-first: invest in automated checks, not code review.

**Verification pyramid**:

| Layer | Tool | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| Symbolic | TLA+ specs | 2 min read |
| Primary | Deterministic Simulation Testing (DST) | ~5 seconds |
| Exhaustive | Model checking (Stateright) | 30-60 seconds |
| Bounded | Bounded verification (Kani) | ~60 seconds |
| Empirical | Telemetry + benchmarks | seconds-minutes |

**DST as workhorse**: each run ~5 seconds, exercises production code through randomized scenarios. Target: 500 seeds per component, 10 million across all components. Caught bugs impossible to find in code review.

**Contracts before code**: core invariants defined upfront. Agent is NOT allowed to invent system meaning. "Semi-formal methods" — specs explicit enough to be checked, cheap enough to run continuously.

**Performance as hill-climbing**: with correctness locked in, agent proposes optimization → full DST → if tests pass, measure throughput → keep or revert.

**Human role**: "define the system idea and invariants, review and strengthen the DST harness, set measurable targets, and approve architectural changes. Everything else was the agent running against the harness."

**Reviews become bloom filters** — a fast gate, not the source of correctness.

## Cursor — Self-Driving Codebases

Built a web browser with ~1,000 commits/hour across 10M tool calls. Almost zero human intervention.

**Architecture evolution**: single agent → shared state (locking hell) → rigid planner/executor (bottleneck) → final: root planner + recursive subplanners + isolated workers with handoffs.

**Key findings**:
- 100% commit correctness caused serialization — accepting some error rate was key
- No cross-talk between workers — convergence through ownership chain
- Duplicate work cheaper than coordination overhead
- Scratchpads should be rewritten, not appended to
- Disk I/O was the bottleneck at scale, not CPU/RAM

## Uber — Minion + Internal AI Stack

92% of devs use agents monthly. 65-72% of code AI-generated. AI costs up 6x since 2024.

**Minion** (background agent platform):
- Monorepos pre-checked-out and ready. Internal infra access via MCP + AIFX CLI
- Optimized defaults (compiling done, tools installed, helpful AGENTS.md)
- Prompt improvement — analyzes and rewrites prompts for higher success rate
- Web, Slack, GitHub PR, and code review interfaces
- 70% of workloads are toil (migrations, upgrades) — higher accuracy = virtuous cycle

**uReview** (AI code review):
- Multiple specialized bots per PR. Comments graded, low-confidence filtered, merged, categorized
- Quality > quantity — worst thing is noisy low-quality comments
- Devs rate usefulness → feedback loop. Bot comments trending down (focus on quality)

**Code Inbox** (smart PR routing):
- Routes based on ownership, compliance, history, timezone, calendar availability
- Risk profiles highlight high-impact changes for extra scrutiny
- SLOs for response times, auto-reassign, escalation

**Key finding**: Claude Code usage nearly doubled in 3 months (32% → 63%), while IDE tools plateaued. Engineers naturally gravitate to multi-agent workflows. Sharing wins between engineers is the most effective adoption tactic — top-down mandates had limited impact.

## Convergent Architecture

Every team converges on: expensive models for planning, cheap for workers. Workers isolated from each other. Filesystem as coordination primitive (not message passing). Accept and correct > prevent all errors. PR as the human oversight gate.
