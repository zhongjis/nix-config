description: Audits and writes AGENTS.md files using execution-first standards. Checks commands, gotchas, and signal-to-noise ratio. Use when asked to audit, review, score, refactor, or improve agent instruction files, fix stale commands, reduce bloat, or asking "my AGENTS.md is bad", "help me write an AGENTS.md", or "improve my agent instructions".

# AGENTS.md Audit

- **IS:** auditing, scoring, refactoring, and writing AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / CLAUDE.local.md instruction files that agents load at session start.
- **IS NOT:** authoring SKILL.md skill files (use `agent-skills-creator`), writing project docs or READMEs (use `docs-writing` or `readme-creator`), or mining session history for instruction suggestions (use `cadence-advise`; this skill audits the file as it exists).

AGENTS.md files are execution contracts, not knowledge bases. **Litmus test for every line:** "Would removing this cause the agent to make a mistake?" If no, cut it. Bloated instruction files cause agents to ignore the rules that matter.

AGENTS.md is the tool-agnostic source of truth. Agents load `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CLAUDE.local.md` natively from any directory level, no symlinks needed. If a project has only a `CLAUDE.md`, recommend `mv CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md`.

## Reference Files

| File | Read when |
|------|-----------|
| `references/quick-checklist.md` | Every audit; the default 10-check triage (target >= 8/10) |
| `references/quality-criteria.md` | Quick audit fails, file is high-risk, or user requests full scoring (45 checks, letter grades) |
| `references/refactor-workflow.md` | File is bloated (root over ~150 lines), stale, or scores below target |
| `references/root-content-guidance.md` | Deciding what stays in root vs moves behind `@import`; file placement hierarchy |
| `references/templates.md` | Drafting a new file or rebuilding one from scratch |

## Writing From Scratch

No instruction file exists? Skip the audit steps: gather real commands from the project manifest (`package.json`, `Makefile`, CI config), pick a skeleton from `references/templates.md`, fill it with verified commands and any known gotchas, then validate against `references/quick-checklist.md` before delivering.

## Audit Workflow

Copy this checklist to track progress:

```
Audit Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Discover files
- [ ] Step 2: Select audit mode (quick or full)
- [ ] Step 3: Run audit and score
- [ ] Step 4: Report findings with score table
- [ ] Step 5: Propose minimal diffs
- [ ] Step 6: Validate changes
- [ ] Step 7: Apply and report before/after scores
```

### Step 1: Discover files

```bash
find . \( -name "AGENTS.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.local.md" \) 2>/dev/null | sort
```

Also check `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (applies to every session). For monorepos, include workspace-level AGENTS.md files. Audit each level independently: root holds universal rules; child files hold directory-specific rules (see the placement hierarchy in `references/root-content-guidance.md`).

### Step 2: Select audit mode

- **Quick audit** (default): 10 checks from `references/quick-checklist.md`, target >= 8/10.
- **Full audit**: 45 checks from `references/quality-criteria.md`, target >= 91% of applicable points (grade A). Use when the quick audit fails, the file gates a high-risk repo, or the user asks for full scoring.

### Step 3: Run audit and score

Score each root file independently. `N/A` checks are excluded from the denominator.

### Step 4: Report findings

Output a concise report before any edits:

```markdown
## AGENTS.md Audit Report

| File | Mode | Score | Grade | Key Issues |
|------|------|-------|-------|------------|
| ./AGENTS.md | Quick | 6/10 | Fail | Missing test command, stale path, doc-heavy section |
```

Every issue named in the table must map to a proposed diff in Step 5; no vague findings.

### Step 5: Propose minimal diffs

In priority order:

1. Fix broken or stale commands; these are bugs, not style.
2. Remove generic, duplicate, or obsolete guidance.
3. Move non-universal detail behind `@path/to/file.md` imports.
4. Add emphasis ("IMPORTANT:", "YOU MUST") only on critical rules agents demonstrably skip.

Show each change as a diff snippet with one-line rationale. Apply only after the user confirms.

### Step 6: Validate changes

1. Smoke-run core commands (`dev`, `test`, `build`, `lint`/`typecheck`) where the environment allows; otherwise verify the script exists in the manifest and note the limitation in the report.
2. Check every linked and `@import`ed path resolves.
3. Confirm no contradictory rules remain across levels (home, root, child).
4. Issues found → revise → validate again. Do not proceed on "looks right".

### Step 7: Apply and report

Apply approved edits, re-score with the same checklist, and report before/after scores plus line counts. After future PRs, add at most one new gotcha, and only if it prevented or fixed a real mistake.

## Gotchas

- `@import` lines are not evaluated inside code spans or fenced blocks; a real import wrapped in backticks silently never loads. Conversely, example imports inside fenced blocks are safe to show.
- `@import` chains stop resolving at 5 hops; content behind a deeper chain silently disappears from context.
- Child-directory AGENTS.md files load on demand when the agent works in that subtree, not at session start, so a universal rule placed only in a child file is invisible to most tasks. Promote it to root.
- Don't put project-specific commands in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; it loads in every session, so one project's `npm run dev` becomes noise (or a wrong command) everywhere else.
- Don't audit `CLAUDE.local.md` as strictly as AGENTS.md; it is gitignored personal config, so flag only broken commands and contradictions with the shared file.
- Don't strip emphasis markers (IMPORTANT, YOU MUST) during a density cut; they exist because the default phrasing was already ignored once.
- A passing quick score does not prove commands run; stale commands hide behind checklist passes. Step 6 smoke-runs are not optional.
- Don't rewrite a whole file when targeted diffs would pass the audit; full rewrites destroy battle-tested wording and inflate review burden.
