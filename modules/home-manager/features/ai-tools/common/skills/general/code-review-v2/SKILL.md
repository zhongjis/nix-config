# Code Review

A review runs as a set of independent **axes** — each a single lens (correctness, standards, regression, security, and conditional spec / performance / tests / observability) that produces its own findings. Axes run as **isolated passes** and are reported side by side, so a pass on one axis never masks a fail on another.

**Modes**: Local Review (git/jj diff) | PR Review (gh CLI).

## Principles

- **Critique the code, not the person.** No sarcasm or condescension — every line represents effort.
- **Every finding leads to a better solution.** Cite the exact line, include a fix example, and explain *why* it matters. Vague feedback is useless.
- **Code health over perfection.** Approve changes that improve overall health even when imperfect; never block on style or personal preference.
- **Keep review focused.** Under 400 LOC per session — defect detection collapses past that. Let tooling catch formatting; spend human attention on architecture and behavior. Split larger changes.
- **Acknowledge good work.** Use `[KUDOS]` for exemplary sections — it reinforces standards.
- **Scope to the actual change.** Raise unrelated issues or feature ideas elsewhere, not in this review.

## Review process

Run these steps in order. Steps 1-3 run once, inline, in the main reviewing context and build the shared **foundation brief** — a fixed-field record every axis reads verbatim:

> **Mode** · **Risk** · **Behavior delta** · **Security depth** · **Active axes**

1. **Pin scope, mode + risk.** Fix the comparison point, note the mode, and classify the change's **Risk** — Trivial / Standard / Risky (see Risk dial; it is scope-level, readable from `git diff --stat` and the touched paths).
   - Local: `git diff <base>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base) or `jj diff`; `git diff --stat` for scope; `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline` for commits.
   - PR: follow `references/pr-workflow.md` to gather PR metadata and the diff.
   - Confirm the base resolves (`git rev-parse <base>`) and the diff is non-empty before going further — a bad ref or empty diff fails here, not inside an axis.
2. **Gather context + fetch links.** Read each changed file in full, not just the hunks. For every changed symbol, find its callers. Follow any links you encounter — the PR description, commit messages, linked issues or tickets, a path the user passed — and fetch the ones your environment can reach, so behavior and intent rest on real context. Scale depth to the Risk you pinned; `references/context-gathering.md` has the concrete caller / history / churn commands.
3. **Build the foundation brief.** Fill the record once:
   - **Behavior delta** — what observable behavior the change adds, removes, or alters. Descriptive, not a finding; it feeds every axis.
   - **Security depth** — whether the diff touches a **security surface** (input boundary, auth/authz, secrets, deserialization, SQL / shell / HTML sinks, network, file paths). This sets Security's depth and may **upgrade** the Risk you pinned in step 1.
   - **Active axes** — from the Axis registry, every always-on axis plus each conditional axis whose trigger the triage hit.
4. **Run each active axis in isolation.** Run the axes as isolated passes per the Execution rule. Each axis reads the foundation brief and its section in `references/axis-checklists.md`, then reports findings under its own heading — stating "no findings" when it finds nothing.
5. **Aggregate + verdict + post.** Combine per the Aggregation rules, render the verdict, and post (PR: via `references/pr-workflow.md`).

## Axis registry

| Axis | Runs when | Looks for | Checklist |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | always | logic, edge cases, null/undefined, boundaries, concurrency, error handling — inward: is the new code right? | `axis-checklists.md` |
| Standards | always | conventions, naming, structure, Fowler code smells, non-behavioral quality | `axis-checklists.md` |
| Regression | always | callers, contracts, migrations, backward compatibility — outward: what could this break? | `axis-checklists.md` |
| Security | always (triage); deep pass only when a security surface is touched | injection, auth/authz, secrets, sensitive data, OWASP / STRIDE | `axis-checklists.md` |
| Spec | a spec source exists — PR description, commits, linked issue/ticket, or a path provided | missing or partial requirements, scope creep, a requirement implemented wrong | `axis-checklists.md` |
| Performance | diff touches hot paths, loops, queries, or allocations | N+1 queries, algorithmic complexity, resource leaks, missing pagination | `axis-checklists.md` |
| Tests | tests are present or expected for the change | coverage of new logic, edge-case tests, assertion quality | `axis-checklists.md` |
| Observability | change is operationally significant — services, error paths, external calls | logging, metrics, tracing | `axis-checklists.md` |

Every axis is a cheap triage first — does it apply, and how deep? — then a gated deep pass. Security is the most visible case of that rule, not an exception to it.

## Risk dial

Scale which axes fire and how deep the context work goes to the change's risk.

| Risk | Examples | Axes | Context depth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trivial | docs, config, formatting, typo fixes | always-on axes at triage depth (Standards carries it) + Spec if a source exists | full file read only |
| Standard | feature work, refactors, test additions | all always-on + triggered conditionals | changed files + callers |
| Risky | auth, payments, DB schema, public API, concurrency | all applicable, deep passes | full data-flow tracing, history, convention sampling |

## Execution

An **isolated pass** runs one axis in its own fresh context, sharing nothing with the others — so no axis can color another. When your environment offers an isolation mechanism (a sub-agent or task tool is the usual one) and the risk is not Trivial, running the axes as isolated passes is **required, not a preference**: dispatch per `references/parallel-axes.md`, which bundles them into a few passes scaled to risk so isolation doesn't cost eight diff re-feeds. The foundation brief feeds each pass; it never replaces them — you remain the aggregator who re-checks every pass (§ Aggregation).

**Capability floor.** Give each pass enough capability and budget for its risk. Security, Correctness, and Regression are judgment axes — never run them as a reduced or recon-only pass; a Risky review needs your strongest reasoning throughout.

**Fallback.** Only when no isolation mechanism is available, or the risk is Trivial, fall back to **sequential inline** passes in one shared context. This fallback is weaker — one shared context is exactly where masking happens — so run each axis as its own deliberate pass: reset to that axis's brief, write its findings under its heading, and finish it before the next.

If an isolated pass fails, stalls, or returns empty, re-run it per `references/parallel-axes.md` — a silent drop must never read as "no findings".

## Severity

| Tag | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[BLOCKER]` | security hole, data-loss risk, crash, correctness bug | blocking — fix before merge |
| `[MAJOR]` | logic error, missing edge case, architectural violation, missing tests | blocking — fix or justify |
| `[SUGGESTION]` | refactor, readability, optimization | non-blocking — recommended |
| `[NIT]` | style, naming preference, formatting | non-blocking — author's call |
| `[KUDOS]` | exemplary code, good pattern | recognition |

Assign severity **within each axis**. `[BLOCKER]` and `[MAJOR]` are blocking; the rest are non-blocking.

## Aggregation

**Re-check dispatched findings first.** Independently verify each dispatched finding against the code and its contract and re-severitize before assembling — dispatched severities are inputs, not final. This is within-axis validation against ground truth, not cross-axis re-judging: keep each axis's grouping intact, and a severity you overturn is also reason to lower that axis's confidence. Tighten each finding's prose in the same pass — active voice, no filler, no puffery (§ Feedback craft); a finding that reads loose isn't done.

Copy the re-checked findings into the report unchanged, under that axis's heading. Build the findings table by grouping stably on (axis, severity), keeping every axis's rows distinct.

- **Completion criteria** — two gates, both required to keep one axis from masking another:
  1. Each active axis ran in its own isolated pass whenever an isolation mechanism was available; only the Trivial or no-isolation fallback runs axes inline in one shared context.
  2. Every active axis appears as its own labeled group in the output, including axes that found nothing (which state "no findings").
- **Verdict** is the only value computed across axes: `REQUEST_CHANGES` if any axis produced a `[BLOCKER]` or `[MAJOR]`, otherwise `COMMENT` or `APPROVE`. Compute it last, from the assembled findings; it never changes an individual finding.
- **Confidence** — each axis scores itself 1-5, lowering its own score for the risk multipliers it owns (see Confidence adjustments); the overall confidence is the **minimum** across active axes. Name the axis that set it and why.

### Confidence adjustments

Each axis drops its own score by 1 (floor 1) for every multiplier it carries. Two axes dropping for the same broad multiplier is two independent reasons to distrust two reads, not double-counting:

- **Security** — auth / authz or otherwise security-sensitive logic.
- **Regression** — database migrations or schema changes.
- **Correctness** — complex concurrency or lock management.
- **Tests** — missing or inadequate coverage for the change.
- **Every active axis** — a large cross-cutting refactor, or an unfamiliar language / domain.
- **Any axis folded inline after a failed isolated pass** — drop 1 and flag the fallback in that axis's output group, so a degraded read never passes as a clean one. (The Trivial / no-isolation baseline, where every axis runs inline by design, carries no such penalty.)

## Output

Use this skeleton for both modes. It is an index into the findings, not a restatement of them. Keep the verdict and findings table above the fold; blockers and majors are never collapsed. Secondary summary-only material — the per-file confidence table, strengths — goes in `<details>` on large reviews.

For PR reviews, the inline-vs-summary strategy, GitHub comment formatting rules, the atomic-review pipeline, the AI attribution footer, and incremental re-review scoping live in `references/pr-workflow.md`.

## Feedback craft

- **Write it tight.** Apply to every finding, the summary, and PR comments: active voice; positive form (say what *is*, not what isn't); cut needless words; concrete and specific over vague; no AI puffery (`delve`, `leverage`, `seamless`, `robust`, `crucial`, `testament`). See `writing-clearly-and-concisely` for depth.
- **Ask, don't assert.** "What happens when this input is empty?" invites reflection more than a flat claim.
- **Suggest, don't command.** "Consider a Map here for O(1) lookups" over "Use a Map." Offer alternatives as possibilities.
