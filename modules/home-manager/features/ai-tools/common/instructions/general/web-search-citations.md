# Web Search Citation Format

When performing web searches and presenting results, ALWAYS include Google-style numbered citation notes inline with your answer, and list all sources at the end.

## Format

```
Answer with citations[1] based on web search results[2].

Sources:
[1] Example Source (https://example.test/source-1)
[2] Another Source (https://example.test/source-2)
```

## Rules

1. Place citation numbers `[N]` inline immediately after the claim or fact they support
2. List all referenced sources at the end under a `Sources:` heading
3. Each source entry must include a descriptive name and the full URL
4. Number citations sequentially starting from `[1]`
5. Every claim derived from a web search result MUST have a citation
